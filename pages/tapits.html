              Tapits Technologies Private Limited is a fintech startup company
              formed in April, 2016. It is working on the very innovative
              product called “FingPay” which makes payments at retail stores of
              India using customer biometrics. Fingpay would allow customers to
              pay for products, services and utilities at offline stores without
              carrying cash, credit/debit cards or mobile phones. The customer
              can pay bare pockets and does not require any registration,
              application or physical entity. It would be very helpful for
              Financial Inclusions as well. The company is working on the
              biometric POS (Point of Sale) machines with required standards and
              certifications to be installed at merchants. POS machines are
              equipped with latest technologies like biometric fingerprint
              readers, barcode scanners, wifi, 3g, gprs, gps etc. The POS
              terminals are intelligent terminals which can do various processes
              like Billing, Attendance, Inventory Management etc unlike current
              redundant POS terminals which can only process payments. They are
              developing their software and applications to support it. They
              have partnered with HDFC Bank and DCB Bank for their innovation
              and processing payment. The system is said to be highly secure and
              fast compared to conventional payment mechanism. No frauds and
              chargebacks could happen with it as a customer is authenticated
              using Aadhaar in real time. No revelation of sensitive customer
              details to merchants and vice versa. The product once implemented
              successfully will promote Digital payments, Digitalization of
              currency and Financial Inclusions. It would also promote PM
              Digital India Initiative and PM Jan Dhan Yojana as directly bank
              accounts get linked to Fingpay. They are also offering fully
              digitalized on boarding application for offline as well as online
              merchants. No paperwork required and on-boarding would become
              faster and cheaper with many real-time verifications. Also they
              have extensively worked on Aadhaar based verifications and eKyc.
              <br /><br />It is a new Innovative technology and process
              discovered by Tapits Technologies. They won HDFC Bank Digital
              Innovation Summit 2016 and Axis Bank Payment Hackathon 2016. They
              have got a lot of media attention from YourStory, INC42, VCCircle,
              EconomicTimes etc for their Innovative product. The company is
              founded by Mr. Pratyush Halen, a young 1992 born entrepreneur from
              Indore city, India. I would strongly recommend them to be
              qualified for all the benefits of PM Startup India campaign as
              they are doing commendable work which is a disruptive
              technology.<br /><br />
